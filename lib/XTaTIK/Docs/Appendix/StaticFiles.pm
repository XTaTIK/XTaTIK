=head1 NAME

XTaTIK::Docs::Appendix::StaticFiles - Map of XTaTIK static files you can override

=head1 PRECEDENCE

Static files can be found in XTaTIK core, your Company Silo, and your
Site Silo. If files of the same name exist, your Site Silo location
will take precedence over Company Silo, which in turn takes precedence
over files in XTaTIK core.

This, of course, does mean you can place a static file into your
Company Silo and it will be available to all of your Sites.

=head1 XTaTIK CORE FILES TO OVERRIDE

These static files you can override directly from either your
company or site silos. You'll likely won't ever need to touch the SASS
files, however.

=item * C<nopic.jpg>—the image file to display when product photo is not
    available

=item * C<nav-logo.png>—the little logo to display in the nav on every
    page. This file does not exist by default and if neither
    Site nor Company silos have this file, market/company text will be
    shown instead

=item * C<index-logo.png>—the large logo displayed on the home page
    during shoutout animation

=item * I<sass files>—these files are used to provide XTaTIK
    core styles. Generally, you'd use additional Company/Site SASS files
    instead of overriding core files. B<Note:> this also means
    the filenames mentioned above are I<reserved> and cannot be used
    by Company/Site silos without the overriding effect.
